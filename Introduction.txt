#GSM = Global Stiffness Matrix.
#LSM = Local Stiffness Matrix.
#n = Vector that Quantify the informations that should be inserted in the Structure. [Number of Nodes ; Number of Elements ; Number of Restrained Nodes ; Number of Loadings]
#nodes, elements, supports and loadings are matrices that restrain the information in vectors, or, its a vector of a vectors.
#nodes = Matrix that holds all the nodes in it. [Node Index , Node X-Coord , Node Y-Coord]
#elements = Matrix that holds all the element informations in it. [Element Index , Connectivity , Young's Modulus , Poisson Ratio, Thickness , Strain/Stress ]
#suports = Matrix that holds the nondisplaceable nodes. [Support Index , Acting Node , X-Constrain , Y-Constrain] 1 - Free to Displace ; 0 - Constrained Node
#loadings = Matrix that holds all the loadings applied. [Force Index , Acting Node , X-Force , Y-Force]

#coord = Matrix that restrain the elements X and Y coordinates
#u = vector that holds if a node can displace or not
#F = Force Vector
#desloc = Nodes Displacements
#cargas = Nodes Applied Forces
#function GlobalStiffness
  A function that it's goal is to Assemble the GSM (K Matrix) by assembling first LSM (k Matrix).
#function fixednodes
  A function that is supposed to get all the nodes in the mesh and read if the node is constrained or not in X or Y axis (and in some cases rotation). This is first done so can be applied boundary conditions at K.
#function boundaryconditions
  By the pre-obtained u-vector that holds if a node can displace or not, this function will apply the boundary conditions at the Global Matrix so the sparse one is setted by substituting the main-diagonal with 1 and the row and column with zeros at nodes that can't displace.
